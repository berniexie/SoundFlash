# SoundFlash
Design and Developed at TreeHacks 2015 by Bernard Xie and Alex Koh, SoundFlash is a iOS Application that is able
to play music and output different colors based on the output of the song itself. We took periodic measurements of
the output volume of the song to distinguish different classes of "power" to produce different colors. This was the
first iOS application built by both Bernard and Alex, as well as their first venture into Objective-C and Cocoa Touch.
